# Passion not spent

<pre>
What's my great fear?
I'll tell you; come near.
To lay down in death
with so much left.

Passion not spent -
Oh cowardly regret!
For fear of others?
The thousand deaths.

I'm afraid to die
With no twinkle in my eye
To pass meagerly by
Yet hidden inside.     

To walk through life
Not truly alive
And to leave in the night
With an unfelt "goodbye".
</pre>
